# Eat-Da-Burger

# Description
This website demonstrates how an ORM can be used to smoothly facilitate interactions between a server and a database. The user interface is bare-bones; its main purpose is to make GET and POST requests to the server based on user input, which in turn makes standard CRUD queries to the database. After the responses to the queries are returned, the user interface dynamically updates. 

# Installation
After downloading the above files, you will require the following npm packages to run this program locally (listed in package.json):
* `express`
* `express-handlebars`
* `mysql`

# Usage

It will be shown in the **Waiting area**. To move the burger in the **Devoured** section, simply click on the **devour** button next to the burger.
